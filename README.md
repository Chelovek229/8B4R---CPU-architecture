# 8B4R---CPU-architecture
A simple indie CPU architecture written in C++ and assembly features a minimalistic instruction set, custom memory model, and basic ALU operations. C++ handles simulation and I/O, while assembly defines low-level behavior. Ideal for learning pipelining, opcode decoding, and hardware-software integration.
